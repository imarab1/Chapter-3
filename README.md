This program solves a quadratic equation. We use parameters to directly give us our a, b, and c. 
### 3.15
This program finds the volume of a sphere. Not only do we use parameters, but we also use different math functions. We use Math.pi, which allows us to use pi(3.14159) and math.pow which takes the power of a number.

This program takes someones first and last name and reverses it. We import java.util for the scanner. Scanner is used to read the inputs in a java program, this allows to have an interactive program.
